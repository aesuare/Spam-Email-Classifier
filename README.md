# AIBall

The **_```AIBall```_** is my attempt to create an open-source virtual assistant.

> Inspired by the likes of Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, the **_```AIBall```_** is engineered to execute commands spoken by the client user

What the end goal of this project looks like is yet to be determined, but this is much more about the process than the end result.

Cheers!
