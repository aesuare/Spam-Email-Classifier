# Spam Email Classification Model


This repository is built around a model that predicts whether any given email is spam, or not spam (ham)! 

It uses ```Naive Bayes``` techniques to power its predictions. 

In simple terms, the ```Naive Bayes``` classification technique quantifies the relationship between the presence of a feature and the likelihood of a certain outcome. 

Here is a non-machine learning example:



> Imagine an object that is red, round, has a stem on top, and is about 3 inches in diameter. The presence of these features might lead you to believe that this object is likely an apple, which it is!

```Naive Bayes``` is simply the mathematical representation of feature-outcome relationships. In this repo, we use all information in the email's contents to determine whether the email is likely to be spam or ham. Not only does the model consider the email's message text, but header, datetime, sender, etc.


While this repository isn't necessarily all that useful, as the model is rather static unless you were to expand on it, I thought this was a cool project nonetheless. I found this to be a rather rewarding learning experience, can't wait to do more stuff just like this.
